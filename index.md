title: Kanigal Harvest
---



## The Cause
In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognized food as a human right. But, even today so many people go hungry each day. Around 200 million tons of food are wasted in gardens in America each year. Connecting those two would benefit many.

## Who am I
I am a high school student in the Bay Area hoping to positively benefit the community.

## Inspiration
I was walking around my community and I saw so many trees in my neighborhood. It was around Autumn and there were so many fruits on the ground. I saw ants slowly taking away food for themselves. I also saw a squirrel eating some fruits. Even after that there was plenty. Later that day I saw a man holding a sign on the road begging for food for his children. At that moment I had thought of this idea.
